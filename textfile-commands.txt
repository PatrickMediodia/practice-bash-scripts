less
  - less {path}
  - opens the file in a pager for easy reading
  - another option is more {path} but is more limited

cat
  - cat {path}
  - shows the contents of the file on the screen, useful for smaller files
  - might be too much for larger files
  - use tap {path} to reverse the output

sort
  - sort {path}
  - sorts the text files

head
  - head {path} -> shows first 10 lines
  - head -n 5 {path} -> shows first 5 lines
  - head -5 {path} -> also valid

tail
  - tail {path} -> shows last 10 lines
  - tail -n 5 {path} -> shows last 5 lines
  - tail -5 {path} -> also valid
  - tail -f {path} -> monitors the file for changes, useful for logs

cut
  - cut -d"{delimiter}" -f{column number} {path} -> extract columns from a file
  - cut -c {range, ex. 1-5} {path} -> extracts characters from the columns,in this case characters 1 to 5

wc
  - shows the count of lines, words, and characters
  - wc {-l -w -c} {path}
  - use the delimiters -l for lines, -w for words, -c for characters

anchors
  - ^ -> start of the line/file
  - $ -> end of the line/file

awk
  - awk -F ':' '{print $1}' -> -F flag for filter, : for the delimiter, and $1 for which column
  - awk '/{pattern}/' {print} {path} -> follows a specific pattern

grep
  - general regular expression parser 
  - grep '{regex}' {path} -> outputs the whole line that matches the regex
  - grep {flags} '{regex}' {path} -> makes the search case insentitive
    - i -> case insensitive search
    - v -> inverse of matching regex, shows all that does not match the expressions
    - B {number} -> shows the lines before the line with the matching expression
    - A {number} -> shows the lines after the line with the matching expression
  - grep [a-z] {path} -> finds the occurances of a to z in the file
  - grep [a-zA-Z0-9] {path} -> finds the occurances of alphanumeric characters
  - grep [[:alpha:]] {path} -> finds all of the alphabetical characters in the file
  - egrep ^[0-9]{3} {path} -> find the occurances where the first 3 characters of a line is a number
  - egrep '^[0-9]{3,4}' {path} -> same as the expression above but includes either the first 3 or 4 numbers
  - ls | egrep {filename} -> list all files using a regular expression (. represents any character)
  - ls | egrep {filename}. -> . is a wildcard that allows any one (1) character after the expression
  - ls | egrep {filename}.* -> lists all files using a regular expression including . (any character) and * (unlimited amount of times)
  - egrep ^[Q].{5} {path} -> starting with letter Q and get wildcard 5 times

sed
  - sed -n '2,5p' {path} -> shows lines 2 to 5 from the file, -n flag mutes it
  - sed 's/old/new/{occurance#}' {path} -> changes text from old to new in specific occurance number
  - sed 's/old/new/{g}' {path} -> changes text from old to new on all occurances
  - sed 's/thingtodelete/d' {path} -> deletes occurances of text
  - sed 's/$/ end' {path} -> appends the text ' end' to the end of the file
  - sed 's/^/start ' {path} -> append the text 'start ' to the start of the files

Notes:
  - | (piped) command is used to get the output of the first expression as an input to the second
    - { expression } -> output | -> input { expression }
  - remember to use egrep or grep -e when using extended regular expressions
  - Remember that > is used to overwrite contents while >> will append contents
  - touch can also be used to update file edit timestamp
    - touch {filename}{range} can be used. Ex. touch file{1..5}
  - dont use sed with the -i flag since it will also edit the file (in-place)

Lecture Activity
1. Peek into the file /usr/share/dict/words using less
  - less /usr/share/dict/words
2. Display all contents of the file /usr/share/dict/words (this will be a lot, you can cancel by pressing Ctrl + C)
  - cat /usr/share/dict/words
3. Display the first 10 words in /usr/share/dict/words using head
  - head /usr/share/dict/words
4. Display the first 20 words in /usr/share/dict/words using head
  - head -20 /usr/share/dict/words
5. Display the last 10 words in /usr/share/dict/words using tail
  - tail /usr/share/dict/words
6. Display the last 20 words in /usr/share/dict/words using tail
  - tail -20 /usr/share/dict/words
7. Display the number of words listed in /usr/share/dict/words using wc
  - wc -w /usr/share/dict/words
8. Display the number of words listed /usr/share/dict/words that only ends in ‘ing’.
  - grep 'ing$' /usr/share/dict/words | wc -w
